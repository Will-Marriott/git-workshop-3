There once was a man named Mickey Who grew lots of weed that was sticky He wanted to sell his empire But that sparked a lot of fire From gangsters and thugs who were tricky

They tried to blackmail and bribe him They tried to rob and outsmart him But Mickey was clever and tough He knew how to deal with their bluff He had his loyal Ray to guide him

He also had his wife Rosalind Who ran a garage and could fend She helped him fight off the bad guys With her wit and her guns as allies She was his partner till the end

But who was the one telling this tale? It was Fletcher, a sneaky blackmailer He had a screenplay called Bush That he hoped to sell for some cash But he ended up in a container

Mickey managed to keep his domain 
And made a deal with Berger, the American 
He got his money and his peace And his weed business did not cease 
He remained the gentleman of London
